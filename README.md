# Build Bunny

I'm Ryan â€” founder of Build Bunny, a one-man digital tradeshop (for now). I help businesses cut the chaos with clean, custom software that actually gets used. Whether it's a mobile app for the field, a dashboard for your ops team, or rebuilding something duct-taped together in Excel, I handle the full stack and guide you through it.

I've built tools used by 800+ person companies and scrappy teams alike. I donâ€™t just write code â€” I help you figure out what to build, how it should work, and how to keep it running.

If you're not technical, no problem â€” Iâ€™ll guide you every step of the way.
If you are, even better â€” letâ€™s partner up and knock something out fast.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Do Best:

- Web & mobile apps that fit how your team works

- Legacy rebuilds (Access, Excel, FileMaker â†’ modern stacks)

- Full-stack development from idea to deploy

- Systems that talk to each other (integrations + automation)

## ðŸ§° Tech I Use (and love):

Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, React, React Native, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, GCP, n8n, Retool, Auth0, and more

Typical projects land in the $2.5kâ€“$10k range â€” fixed-scope, fast-moving, and built to last. If youâ€™ve got a real problem to solve and want clean code from someone who gets it done â€” letâ€™s talk.
